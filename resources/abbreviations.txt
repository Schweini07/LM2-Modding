This is a repository containing tools and resources like notes I have written while researching Luigi's Mansion 2.

## Resources
I am planning a writeup on the structure of .dict and .data files, currently there are notes located with offsets and there meaning for .dict files, as well as individual files that can be extracted from .data files
There is also small text file containing guesses at what certain abbreviations the game uses mean

## Tools
Currently a tool for extracting data out of .dict and .data files is being written. It is still in its very early stages, but progresses parallel with my research of the game
