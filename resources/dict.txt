.dict:
- sourced from https://github.com/hadashisora/LM2L
- and https://github.com/KillzXGaming/NextLevelLibrary/blob/master/Games/LM2/DICT_Parser.cs

- art/feghosts/boo.dict was used as reference here
- everything is encoded in little endian

- 0x0-0x3: identifier - 58 24 F3 A9
- 0x4-0x5: header flags
- 0x6: compression flag - 0x0 -> uncompressed; 0x1 -> compressed with zlib
- 0x7: padding
- 0x8-0xb: file count -> amount of chunks in .data that can be formatted to a file
- (0x9: maybe string count) 
- 0xc-0xf: largest compressed file
- 0x10 - 0x2b: unknown

=== From here the file structure can be dependent on what the file count is. Most of the time .dict files in Luigi's Mansion 2 contain 8 files, so we'll assume that this is the case here  ===
- 0x2c-0x33: correlates to the amount of files in the .dict, but purpose unknown

=== Every file is now given properties with 4*4 bytes, for demonstration only one file and it's properties are listed in this document ===
- 0x34-0x37: offset in the .data file
- 0x38-0x3b: decompressed file length
- 0x3c-0x3f: compressed file length
- 0x40-0x43: flags -> two resource flags and one resource index

.data:
file0 -> File table
file1 -> File table debug (probably)
file2 -> Texture data (identifier 0x50D377E9)
file3 -> Model data
